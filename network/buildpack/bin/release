# The bin/release script is responsible for providing chaincode metadata to the peer.
# bin/release is optional. If it is not provided, this step is skipped.
#
# The peer invokes release with two arguments:
# bin/release BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR RELEASE_OUTPUT_DIR
#
# When release is invoked, BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR contains the artifacts
# populated by the build program and should be treated as read only input.
# RELEASE_OUTPUT_DIR is the directory where release must place artifacts to be consumed by the peer.
